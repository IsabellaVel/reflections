Last time I tried to write a new story,
I first started with a pumpkin spice latte.
It always tastes good when I make it at home.
This time, though, I added too mcuh black pepper.
So that was too chilly I would think.
Then, I started listening to some music and
thinking where I would like to trabel next month.
