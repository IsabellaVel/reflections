#Travel In Space and Time

When you want to find something new or a new
meaning to your life, the best way to find yourself
is to travel. You can find a frind to join you
or you can also take your dog with you.
Many times just jumping into the car and
trying a new route will be enough to keep
you inspired.
Otherwise, your dog will be fun enough too,
if not barking too much in the car.
